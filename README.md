Serious-Tech-Job-Seekers-Page
Welcome to the Serious Tech Job Seekers Pageâ€”a platform dedicated to helping tech professionals secure remote work and achieve their career goals. My name is Joseph Blythe, and after unexpectedly losing my job on June 3, 2024, I created this page to support Remote Workers, Digital Nomads, and laid-off tech workers. This community is here to provide resources, opportunities, and guidance as you navigate your career journey.
